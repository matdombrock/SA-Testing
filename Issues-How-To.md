## How To Use Issues
[TEMPLATE](#template)

The "issues" page is where we can track any bugs, missing features, suggestions, questions or general issues with the app. Pretty much anything topic we need to talk about should get it's own "issue".

"Issues" let us sort our discussions into specific topics, so we can keep everything clear and organized and see what needs to get done at a glance.

To access the issues page, either click the "Issues" tab in the top bar, or visit [this link](https://github.com/matdombrock/SA-Testing/issues).

Feel free to try creating some test issues to get a feel for how things work. 

Also, I've tried to submit all of the "known" issues that I can think of already (and will keep submitting things I come across). So [check this link](https://github.com/matdombrock/SA-Testing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aknown) to see if I already have your problem listed.

### Submitting An Issue

The more information that I can get about the problem, the easier and faster it is for me to fix.

Ideally, a new issue would contain the following information (**BUT THIS IS NOT REQUIRED**):

* Description: 
  * A General Description of the issue.
* Page(s) URL: 
  * What page or pages is this happening on?
* Reproduction: 
  * If it's a bug, what steps do you do to make this happen?
* User Role: 
  * Is this happening on a User account, a Mediator account or both?
* Account Name: 
  * What is the user name of the account you were loigged into when you noticed this?
* Browser: 
  * What web browser are you using? Chrome, Firefox, Edge ect.

So for example:
```
Description: Deleting a notification does not work.
Page(s): http://sa-test.mzero.space/notifications
Reproduction: Go to the notifications page and try to delete a note. Refresh the page and see the note is still there.
User Role: Both.
Account Name: Gannon Mediora.
Browser: Chrome, Firefox
```
Another Example:
```
Description: Spelling error on Login page.
Page(s): http://sa-test.mzero.space/login
Reproduction: The page says "Sing Up" but should say "Sign Up"
User Role: N/A.
Account Name: N/A.
Browser: Chrome, Firefox
```
## Template
You can copy & paste this template into a new issue:
```
Description: 
Page(s):
Reproduction: 
User Role: 
Account Name: 
Browser: 
```
**I know this is a lot and I don;t want to overwhelm you so if the new issue is a simple question or suggestion, or if the this just feels like too much to worry about for now feel free to disregard the template and just tell me what's going on!**
