## How To Use Issues
The "issues" page is where we can track any bugs, missing features, questions or general issues with the app. 

To access the issues page, either click the issues tab in the top bar, or visit [this link](https://github.com/matdombrock/SA-Testing/issues).

Ideally, a new issue would contain the following information:

```
Description: (A General Description of the issue.)
Page(s) URL: (What page or pages is this happening on?)
Reproduction: (If it's a bug, what steps do you do to make this happen?)
User Role: (Is this happening on a User account, a Mediator account or both?)
Account Name: (What is the user name of the account you were loigged into when you noticed this?)
Browser: (What web browser are you using? Chrome, Firefox, Edge ect.)
```
So for example:
```
Description: Deleting a notification does not work.
Page(s): http://sa-test.mzero.space/notifications
Reproduction: Go to the notifications page and try to delete a note. Refresh the page and see the note is still there.
User Role: Both.
Account Name: Gannon Mediora.
Browser: Chrome, Firefox
```
Another Example:
```
Description: Spelling error on Login page.
Page(s): http://sa-test.mzero.space/login
Reproduction: The page says "Sing Up" but should say "Sign Up"
User Role: N/A.
Account Name: N/A.
Browser: Chrome, Firefox
```
You can copy & paste this template into a new issue:
```
Description: 
Page(s):
Reproduction: 
User Role: 
Account Name: 
Browser: 
```
**If the new issue is a simple question or suggestion feel free to disregard the template!**
