# Hello :)
This is the Sound Agreements Testing Project! 

*Don't forget to bookmark this page now so you can easily find it again.*

Github is a pretty technical looking site, **but don't worry, you won't be using the vast majority of the stuff you see here.** We are just using it for it's awesome project management tools!

The only thing you will need to use here aside from this documentation, is the "Issues" tab. You can safely ignore everything else.

(The actual code is also on GitHub but that's in another project).

**I've written this as a general guide to get you started and hopfully answer you basic questions about how everything works. However please feel free to ask me about anything!**
